# Restart checks

Real-HA checks of behaviour across a restart. They don't get restarts of their own.
Each is set up at the end of a real-HA run, then checked at the start of the next
run, after the restart that installing that run's code needs anyway. pytest
(`tests/test_restore.py`) covers every restore path in the phase that adds it;
this ledger confirms them against a real instance.

A check that's still pending when the phase plan ends (or before 1.0.0) is
cleared with one deliberate restart. A change to the store's format or migration
still gets a dedicated restart when it's made.
